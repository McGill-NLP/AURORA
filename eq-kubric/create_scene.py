def create_scene(index: int, dataset_type="location", max_num_objects=1, retries=10, log_file="logs/error_log.txt", verbose=False) -> int:
    """
    Attempts to create a data entry point in a dataset by running a Docker container that executes a Python script.

    This function tries to execute a command to create a scene up to a specified number of retries. It logs the attempts and errors to a specified file. If successful, it returns 1; if it fails after all retries, it returns 0.

    Args:
        index (int): The index of the scene to generate, which affects the generate_idx parameter in the command.
        dataset_type (str): The type of the dataset, which customizes the Python script to be executed.
        max_num_objects (int): The maximum number of objects to include in the scene.
        retries (int): The number of attempts to make in case of failure.
        log_file (str): Path to the file where error logs are appended.

    Returns:
        int: 0 if the scene was successfully created, 1 otherwise.

    Raises:
        None directly by the function, but subprocess.run may raise an exception if the command execution fails critically.

    Side Effects:
        Writes to a log file at `log_file` path if any errors occur during the execution.
        Tries to execute a Docker command which can affect system resources and Docker state.
